"""Hierarchy-aware smoothing of per-feature-set BED tracks.

This module implements the "smoothing" step of the annotate pipeline.
The intuition: when a sequence is annotated by querying every k-mer
against the database, the result is a per-position label that can be
noisy — short novel runs (k-mers missing from the index) appear inside
otherwise-uniform feature blocks, and labels can flicker between
sibling features when the k-mer-level evidence is mixed. Smoothing
uses the database's feature hierarchy to clean this up: when two
flanking intervals share a common ancestor in the hierarchy, the noisy
intervals between them are *promoted* to that ancestor, generalising
from "I don't know exactly what this is" to "I know it's at least
this".

Algorithm summary (faithful port of ``smooth_features.py`` with the
``phylogeny → hierarchy`` rename and the ``_specific``-suffix logic
removed):

1. For each sequence (independently), build a list of intervals from
   its rows in the presmoothed BED.
2. Repeatedly scan the list with a moving window. At each position,
   look forward and backward to find the largest window of intervals
   whose features are mutually ancestor-compatible (each is an
   ancestor of the previous, with bounded gap distance), and identify
   any unrelated interval that bounds the window.
3. Compute the LCA of the window's left and right features. Promote
   any interval within the window whose feature is an ancestor of the
   LCA (i.e., less specific) up to the LCA itself.
4. Repeat the entire pass until no interval is promoted (fixed point).

Two sentinels at output time:

* Feature ids of 0 are rendered as ``"novel"`` upstream of this module
  (in :func:`karyoscope.core.io.features.render_feature`); their
  hierarchy label internally is the root (:data:`REQUIRED_ROOT`,
  ``"categorized"``). When emitting BED records we map any interval
  still labelled with the root *and* flagged as novel back to
  ``"novel"``, so users never see the internal sentinel.
* Other intervals can also legitimately end up promoted to the root by
  smoothing (LCA of two top-level siblings is the root). We keep
  those as ``"categorized"`` in the output — the user explicitly
  asked for the smoothed track and the root is a real feature name in
  this database, not an error.

Concurrency: this module exposes :func:`process_seq_chunk` as the
per-worker entry point for ``multiprocessing.Pool``. Workers are
initialised once via :func:`worker_initializer` with the full set of
``(HierarchyIndex, FeaturesForWorker)`` pairs -- one per requested
feature set -- so a single pool can produce all output BEDs in one
streaming pass over the combined BED rather than re-spawning per
feature set. The chunk-flushing boundary is the sequence id (the
BED's first column): a chunk always contains complete sequences,
never a fragment, because smoothing needs the full flanking context
for each sequence.

In *assembly mode* (the default; ``preserve_input_order=True`` in
:func:`karyoscope.core.annotate.annotate`) workers also receive a
per-feature-set temp directory and write their smoothed /
presmoothed output for each ``(feature_set, sequence)`` pair
directly to disk -- the worker returns only small line-count
metadata, avoiding the multi-GB IPC transfer that would otherwise
occur for whole-chromosome chunks. In *reads mode*
(``preserve_input_order=False``, intended for FASTQ/long-read input
with millions of small sequences) workers return the output lines
in a dict and the main process writes them straight to a single
per-feature-set BED.

    The chunk must consist of complete sequences (no fragments).
    Input lines are 4-column combined BED records with the integer
    feature id in column 4 (the C++ binary's output format).

    The chunk is parsed *once* into per-sequence raw
    ``(start, end, feature_id)`` tuples; then for each sequence the
    function iterates over every requested feature set, building an
    FS-specific :class:`Interval` list and running the smoothing
    pipeline. Letting each FS's intermediate state go out of scope
    between iterations keeps peak worker RAM bounded by one FS's
    working set rather than ``N_fs x`` that.

    Return type depends on the mode set in :func:`worker_initializer`:

    * **Assembly mode** (``_worker_tmpdir_by_fs`` is a dict): for each
      ``(fs, seq)`` the BED lines are written directly to
      ``{tmpdir}/{safe_seq_name}.smo`` / ``.pre``. The return value
      is ``{fs: {seq: (n_pre_lines, n_smo_lines)}}`` -- counts only,
      so IPC stays microscopic regardless of chr1-sized output.
    * **Reads mode** (``_worker_tmpdir_by_fs`` is ``None``): returns
      ``{fs: {seq: (smo_lines, pre_lines)}}``. Reads produce small
      per-chunk outputs so this is cheap to transfer.

    Novel feature ids (id 0) are mapped to the hierarchy root
    sentinel internally during smoothing; :func:`_render_for_output`
    rewrites them back to :data:`karyoscope.core.io.features.NOVEL_NAME`
    so users never see the internal sentinel.
