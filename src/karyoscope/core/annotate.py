"""Orchestration for the ``annotate`` command.

The high-level flow:

1. Locate the database and validate its layout.
2. Invoke ``get_featureIDs`` (the vendored C++ helper) against the input
   FASTA. The result is a single combined BED whose 4th column holds
   integer feature ids.
3. Read the database's ``features.tsv`` (and ``hierarchy.tsv`` when
   smoothing is enabled) to learn the mapping from feature ids to
   per-feature-set feature names and the relationships between them.
4. For each requested feature set, stream the combined BED through a
   worker pool that translates feature ids to names, produces the
   *presmoothed* BED (adjacent same-name intervals merged), and
   optionally also runs the hierarchy-aware smoothing pass to produce
   the *smoothed* BED.
5. Optionally bgzip the outputs (default on) and delete files the user
   doesn't want (the combined intermediate, the presmoothed BEDs when
   ``--no-keep-presmoothed`` was passed).

Smoothing is implemented in :mod:`karyoscope.core.smooth` and runs in a
``multiprocessing.Pool``. The number of worker processes is taken from
the same ``--threads`` argument that controls the C++ k-mer query
threads.

# --- dead-worker watchdog -------------------------------------------

# the kernel OOM-killer on a memory-constrained node). The main thread
# blocks forever in ``pool.imap_unordered`` waiting for results that
# will never arrive — observed in practice as multi-hour silent hangs
# on whole-genome HG002 runs against the 50 GB SLURM allocation.
#
# This watchdog runs in a daemon thread, polls the pool's worker list
# every couple of seconds, and on detecting a dead or pool-replaced
# worker, writes an actionable stderr message and calls os._exit(137).
# os._exit bypasses Python cleanup (atexit, TemporaryDirectory) —
# acceptable because the user is already in a failure state, and the
# alternative (signalling the main thread while it's blocked deep in
# C code) is unreliable.

      per-read temp files would scale catastrophically (millions of

      and per-chunk IPC payloads stay small.
    * **(False, *)** -- *no preserve*. Streaming dispatch via
      :meth:`Pool.imap_unordered`: sequences appear in
      worker-completion order. Fastest path when order doesn't

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_path
        FASTA (plain or gzipped) to annotate.
    output_dir
        Directory to write output BEDs to. Created if absent.
    db_root
        KaryoScope database root (typically ``ensure_db_root(...)``).
    db_id
        Specific database id to use, or ``None`` to pick the unique
        installed database (errors if there are zero or many).
    feature_sets
        Restrict output to these feature sets. ``None`` means "all sets
        declared in the database's manifest".
    threads
        Threads for both the C++ k-mer query and the smoothing pool.
        ``0`` means auto (``os.cpu_count()``).
    smooth
        Produce the hierarchy-smoothed BED. Default: ``True``.
    keep_presmoothed
        Keep the presmoothed BED. Default: ``True``. When ``False`` and

    keep_intermediates
        Keep the combined ``.combined.presmoothed.featureIDs.bed`` from
        the C++ step. Default: delete after processing.

        bgzip the per-feature-set output BEDs. Default: yes.

    DatabaseNotFoundError
        If the database can't be resolved or its layout is broken.
